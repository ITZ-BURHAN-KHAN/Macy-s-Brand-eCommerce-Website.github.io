It sounds like I have built the front end of an eCommerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front end of a website refers to the part of the website that users interact with and see when they visit the site. It is responsible for the layout, design, and visual elements of the website, as well as the functionality of certain features. 

Welcome to the Macy's Brand eCommerce Website!

This website is a fully-functional eCommerce platform for the Macy's brand, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features a clean and modern design, easy navigation, and a variety of features to enhance the user experience.
